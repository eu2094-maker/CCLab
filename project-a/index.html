                <h3 class="green">Appearance:</h3>
                <p class="white">The creature looks like a baby deer with a skeletal head, wings, and little claws. It has normal organs and vitals, but only responds to
                    electricity as it seems to be dead or dying
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li class="white">Can jump at a person.</li>
                    <li class="white">Eats human meat.</li>

                    The creature was originally curled up in a ball near a tall tree and the
                    slaughter of a camper. The dead body was mutilated with fresh bites and slash marks. The police suspected that this 
                    creature was responsible for the attack. The creature then jumped at the police officers and bit one of them before 
                    being shot multiple times. Dr.Night reported for duty and carefully took the creature to a lab for further examination.
                    The creature was found to be a hybrid of a deer and some unknown species. It was found to be able to generate and 
                    cooperature with electricity. The creature was named Elektros Cervidae due to its electric capabilities and deer-like appearance. 
                    The creature is currently being studied in a lab and is not yet fully understood. This report has no thoughts or suspicions on the 
                    creature's wings or claws, but it is suspected that they are used for flight and hunting respectively. Though Bob the Cryptid is a 
                    mystery, it is known to be docile unless provoked.

                <br><br>
                <p class="white">You must start the electricity first to awaken the creature before further tests.
                 But it seems to be docile to any human activity, at least for now, because it looks like it was just born a couple days ago. The human must not 
                 provoke the rested body with anything more than turning the electricity on. It is dangerous to approach the creature otherwise as it may think the person is a threat.
